				<h1>Hello, visitor!</h1>
				<p>This relational algebra simulator project is a thesis work for my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.</p>
				<p>During my last semesters I had <em>databases</em> class and the curriculum included 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra">relational algebra</a> as the
					mathematical basis of the database science. As a part of our training we were required to write our own
					relational algebraic expression to solve certain problems, like: <em>Who are those who like at most those fruits as Anne?</em>
				</p>
				<p>Being good students, we were constructing and compiling lines and lines of relational algebraic expressions, but in the end
					the only way for us to know if our solution was correct was to check each other's lines and lines of handwritten notes. NOPE.</p>
				<p>A few semesters earlier we were studying about Turing-machines - a truly amazing concept. To facilitate the understanding of how they work,
					I searched for a <a href="https://martinugarte.com/turingmachine/">Turing-machine simulator</a> which proved to be invaluable in my efforts.
				</p>
				<p>With that in mind, I searched for such a simulator for relational algebra, but I found none. Even my teacher suggested that such a program would be
					useful for teaching. Looking back upon that time I realize that my googling skills failed me 
					as there <em>are</em> relational algebra based database engines out there I didn't find then.
				</p>
				<p>The <a href="http://138.232.66.66/ra/calc.htm">Relational algebra calculator</a> is a web based calculator 
					created by Johannes Kessler at the University of Innsbruck that offers a really exquisite interface.
				</p>
				<p>It turns out that there are some other implementations, although they are probably not as easy to use as web based solutions.
					One of them is <a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~eckberg/relationalcalculusemulator.html">Relational Calculus Emulator</a>, 
					a Java desktop application that even requires MySQL to work. Another concept: translate algebraic expression to SQL and execute that.
				</p>
				<p>Whereas <a href="http://ltworf.github.io/relational/">Relational</a> is a Qt4 application written in Python.</p>
				<p>Anyway, not knowing about these programs, I decided to make one. Even if it is not the first one, it is here, and you are welcome to use it.</p>
